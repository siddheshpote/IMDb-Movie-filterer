# IMDb-Movie-filterer
- In this project I have created a dashboard which can filter out movies based on various features like genre, year, ratings etc and can display the filtered movies along with the description and driectors and various features
- IMDb dataset was used which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset)
- Used python for some basic data transformation and cleaning and finally used Microsoft PowerBI for creating dashboard 
- Since the dataset was too big i couldn't upload it here :cry:
- Also the .pbix file was >25 mb hence I could not insert it here
- [Here](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNTI1N2ZhOWUtM2VkZS00NzAzLWJlMTAtNjIyY2E2ODE3NzQ0IiwidCI6ImQxZjE0MzQ4LWYxYjUtNGEwOS1hYzk5LTdlYmYyMTNjYmM4MSIsImMiOjEwfQ%3D%3D) is the link for the dashboard. You can check the working of the dashboard here.
